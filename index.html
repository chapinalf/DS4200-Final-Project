    <h1>Hotel Booking Data Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Topic Introduction</h3>

    <p>Our dataset concerns customers from different countries making hotel bookings in a specific city hotel and a
        specific resort hotel, with varying costs. We thought this was an interesting topic because there could be
        trends in the relationships between any of the attributes and cost, which likely reflects trends in the real
        world when booking hotels. This could in turn help us and other individuals when booking hotels.</p>

    <h3>Dataset Introduction</h3>

    <p>Our dataset was taken from Kaggle, and was originally called 'Hotel booking demand'. It has over 100,000 rows and
        also 32 columns. Each row of the dataset represents one specific hotel booking, and each column represents one
        of the attributes in relation to the booking, such as the number of weekend/weekday nights booked, the arrival
        date day/month/year, the number of adults/children/babies, the country of origin for the customers, and the cost
        of the booking. </p>

    <h3>Reference Sites</h3>
    <p>Our first reference was a research paper about predicting hotel booking cancellations
        (<a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923623000349">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923623000349</a>).
        The paper describes how the
        researchers integrated Bayesian Networks (probability models) and Machine Learning models to achieve accurate
        hotel booking cancellation predictions. The paper notes that this accuracy would allow hotel owners and managers
        to make effective operating decisions, such as hotel cancellation policies and pricing strategies.
    </p>
    <p>Our second reference was a research article published on a blog about analyzing hotel booking data
        (<a
            href="https://nycdatascience.com/blog/r/hotel-bookings-data-analysis/">https://nycdatascience.com/blog/r/hotel-bookings-data-analysis/</a>).
        The article describes how the researcher
        created an app that studies cancellation patterns in hotel bookings, with an aim to help hotel owners set up
        robust cancellation policies. The researcher found that the type of hotel can be a factor in canceling a
        booking, that there were more third-party cancellations (canceling through a separate website) than direct
        cancellations (canceling through the hotel), and that there were more cancellations during months with higher
        average daily costs (for third-party cancellations).</p>

    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <p>Our first task was to learn overall information about the customers who were making hotel bookings, based on the
        countries they came from. We approached this task by making an interactive map of the countries in the world.
        There is a color scale to indicate concentration of customer origin in each country, as well as a tooltip to
        show the total number of bookings made, the average number of adults per booking, and the average cost of a
        booking in bookings made by people from that country.
    </p>
    <p>Our second task was to learn about how far in advance bookings are made when the bookings are cheapest. We
        approached this task by making an interactive scatter plot of the number of days booked in advance compared to
        the average daily cost of a booking. There are different colors to distinguish bookings made for a city hotel
        versus for a resort hotel, a dropdown menu to select different hotel types, and a dropdown menu to select
        different room types.
    </p>
    <p>Our third task was to learn about what time of the year is typically cheapest to make a booking, as well as
        other details concerning the relationship between time of the year and cost. We approached this task by making a
        static line plot showing the average daily cost of a booking for each arrival week in a year. There are
        different colored points and lines to distinguish between each of the three years in our data.
    </p>
    <p>Our fourth task was to learn about how the number of children in a group for a booking affects the cost of the
        booking. We approached this task by making a static bar graph showing the average daily cost of a booking for
        groups with different numbers of children.
    </p>
    <p>Our fifth task was to learn about whether using a travel agent to make a booking was more likely to result in
        cancellation or not. We approached this task by making a static bar graph showing the number of canceled
        bookings when a travel agent was used and when a travel agent was not used.

        <div class='text'>
            <p>Since we wanted to see both the overall trends in cost over the period of a year and specific times in
                the period of a year when the price was cheapest/most expensive, we thought using a line graph showing
                each of the individual points would be beneficial. We plotted the average cost for each week in a year
                because we thought that plotting each day would be too much information for the reader to digest, and
                that plotting each month would not allow us to see enough specific detail about the price being most
                cheap/expensive. We plotted three different lines (one for each year) because we wanted to use all the
                data given (for the years 2015 - 2017), since just using the data for one year would not give an
                accurate sense of the trends (ex. if we only plotted the year where the price generally increased, but
                the other two years had the price generally decreasing, that would give the reader the wrong idea). We
                plotted each of the three lines in a different shade of purple because we wanted to emphasize that
                although they were different years, the year number is increasing (hence the lighter shade of purple to
                darker shade).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2015, the average daily cost of a hotel booking generally alternated between increasing and
                decreasing between weeks 27 and 53 (around early July through the end of December). The cheapest average
                daily cost was around 59 in week 51 (around mid-December). The cheapest range of average daily costs was
                between weeks 45 and 52 (around early November until late December). The most expensive average daily
                cost was around 116 in week 34 (around late August).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2016, the average daily cost of a hotel booking generally increased between weeks 1 and 34 (around
                the beginning of January through mid-August), and generally decreased between weeks 34 and 53 (around
                mid-August through the end of December). The cheapest average daily cost was around 59 in week 3 (around
                mid-January). The cheapest range of average daily costs was between weeks 2 and 12 (around early January
                through mid-March). The most expensive average daily cost was around 150 in week 34 (around late
                August). The most expensive range of average daily costs was between weeks 28 and 36 (around mid July
                until early September).
            </p>
            <p>In 2017, the average daily cost of a hotel booking generally increased between weeks 1 and 35 (around the
                beginning of January through late August). The cheapest average daily cost was around 72 in week 5
                (around late January). The cheapest range of average daily costs was between weeks 1 and 13 (around the
                beginning of January through late March). The most expensive average daily cost was around 170 in week
                33 (around mid-August). The most expensive range of average daily costs was between weeks 30 and 35
                (around late July through late August).
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, the average daily costs of a hotel booking in 2016 are greater than the average daily costs
                of a hotel booking in 2015 between weeks 27 and 53 (around early July through the end of December). The
                average daily costs of a hotel booking in 2017 are greater than the average daily costs of a hotel
                booking in 2016 between weeks 1 and 35 (around the beginning of January through late August).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a whole, the graph suggests that the average daily cost of a hotel booking appears to increase
                between weeks 1 and 35 (around the beginning of January through late August), and then appears to
                decrease between weeks 35 and 52 (around late August until late December), and then increase again
                between weeks 52 and 53 (from late December until the end of December). The graph suggests that the
                cheapest range of average daily costs appears to be between weeks 2 and 12 (around early January through
                mid-March), and also between weeks 45 and 52 (around early November until late December). The most
                expensive range of average daily costs appears to be between weeks 30 and 35 (around late July through
                late August). The average daily costs of a hotel booking also appear to be getting more expensive with
                each year.
